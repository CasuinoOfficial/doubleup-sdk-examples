/*
  This is an example of a bot that plays the DoubleUp UFO Range game.
  The game requires the player to choose a range between 0 and 100 (2 decimals allowed)
  and a bet type which can either be 0 (INSIDE) or 1 (OUTSIDE).
  For example a range of [53, 68] with bet type 0 will win if the random result is 53 or 54 or 55 or ... up to 68 included.
  An OUTSIDE example is with range [10, 80] and bet type 1, the winning numbers are 1,2,3...,10 and 80,81,82,... 100, a total of 31 winning numbers.
  The payout is inversly proportional to the amount of winning numbers, 10 winning numbers will return 100/10 = 10x our initial bet,
  while 50 winning numbers will return 100/50 = 2x our initial bet.

  In this example we play over 50 (the code for under 50 is also implemented) for a payout of 2x our initial bet. If the first bet is lost we will
  automatically play again with double the stake until we win or we exceed our LOSS_GUARD limit. Ideally this will ensure we will profit the initial
  bet every time.

  DISCLAIMER: This code is provided without any guarantees of any kind. Eventually loss will be incured, it might even be as soon as the first run.
  The authors waive any responsibility, we provide this code as an example of the DoubleUp SDK usage, use it with coins on mainnet at your own risk.s
